# Tomax-News-Exam
As a part of the recruite process at Tomax I was given an exam.</br>
As I understoon my job was to create a server that can request the data desired by the client from the API.</br>
to do so I had to read the API's documentary and create an API key.</br>
The API key is stored in the enviorment properties (.env)</br>

Server Side Implementation: </br>
 - Setting up a Node.js Server
 - Writing down a new route for the request (/news/:category)
 - Writing down a method for the route that requests from the API.
 
Stack: Node.js Typescript
 
Client Side Implementation:
 - Write SearchBar component with request on search.
 - Write the Categories componenet.
 - Write the News Page component.
 - Write the Article page component.
 - Make page responsive
 - Make infinite scroll with message display
 
Stack: React.js Typescript

How to setup the server & client:
 - Download the repository
 - Run "yarn install" in both the "server" and "client" folders.
 - set-up a .enb file in the "server" folder like the .env-example file.
 - run the server by running the command "yarn start" inside the server folder.
 - run the client by running the command "yarn start" inside the client folder.

Problems:
* the News API is mostly not giving us the content and image and the content length is up to 260 characters....

for any question please contact me by EMail, Whatsapp or a Phone call...

Thank you for the opportunity</br>
