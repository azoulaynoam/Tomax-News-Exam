# Tomax-News-Exam
As a part of the recruite process at Tomax I was given an exam.</br>
As I understoon my job was to create a server that can request the data desired by the client from the API.</br>
to do so I had to read the API's documentary and create an API key.</br>
The API key is stored in the enviorment properties (.env)</br>

Server Side Implementation: </br>
 - Setting up a Node.js Server
 - Writing down a new route for the request (/news/:category)
 - Writing down a method for the route that requests from the API.
 
Stack: Node.js Typescript
 
Client Side Implementation:
 - Write SearchBar component with request on search.
 - Write the Categories componenet.
 - Write the News Page component.
 - Write the Article page component.
 - Make page responsive
 - Make infinite scroll with message display
 
Stack: React.js Typescript

Problems:
* the API mostly not giving us the content and image and the content length is up to 260 characters....

Thank you for the opportunity</br>
